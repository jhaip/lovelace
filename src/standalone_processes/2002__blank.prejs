claim it is working

when $photon sees color ( $r, $g, $b ):
    // I'm new
    // cleanup
    claim wish tablet had background color ( 0 , 0 , 0 )
otherwise:
    cleanup
    let r = results[0].r;
    let g = results[0].g;
    let b = results[0].b;
    claim wish tablet had background color ( ${r} , ${g} , ${b} )
end

let x = 5;

when x is ${x},
     ok:
  // yo
